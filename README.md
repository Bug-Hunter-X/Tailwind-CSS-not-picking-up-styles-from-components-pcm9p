# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Picking Up

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components, despite seemingly correct setup.

## Problem Description

The provided `bug.js` file shows an example Tailwind CSS configuration.  Even with components correctly imported and rendered, Tailwind styles aren't being applied. This is likely due to an incorrect configuration of the `content` array.  The `content` array is responsible for instructing Tailwind which files to scan for class names.  An incorrectly configured `content` array prevents Tailwind from identifying the classes in your components.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version of the Tailwind configuration file. The primary change is making sure that the `content` array correctly points to your component files. This array should contain paths to every file where you're using Tailwind classes. Note that the file paths may need adjustments depending on your project's structure.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Observe the difference between the problematic configuration (`bug.js`) and the solution (`bugSolution.js`).

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your Tailwind directives are correctly placed in your HTML.
- Verify that you've correctly run the Tailwind CSS build process to generate your CSS file.
- Double check your import statements in your components to make sure they import Tailwind correctly.
- If the problem persists, consider debugging by adding more detailed logging or examining browser's developer tools to see if the styles are being injected at all and if so, whether there are conflicts.
